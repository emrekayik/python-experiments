# Mumbai University Project - Patient Information System

This Patient Information System is based on Tkinter, a graphical user interface provided by the Python programming language and SQLite,
 a relational database management system contained in a C programming library. It provides a GUI where the user can enter the details of a patient which 
will act as a record in the database. The user can also perform various operations on the records such as adding a new record, updating a record, searching 
for a record, deleting a record and finally display all the records in the database.
